## React JS CSS Landing Pages
A web application built with React JS, with CSS being the main language used. I converted designs(landing pages) from scratch and made it responsive using CSS(i would hanve used scss though)
I tried to structure the react app in a way that will be easily understood by others when they are reading or going through the codebase, i also tried to structure the codebase using best practices by trying to break down the design into small chuncks...

## How to run (Open source in view soon)
1. Fork or download the app(by cloning it to your local machine) and open the folder in your cli
2. install all dependencies using the `yarn add` command
3. Start the web server using the `yarn start` command, the app will be served at http://localhost:3000/
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to view the app.
